# Translate_Using_OCR
Android Application for language translation like as google translate, but text traslation made based on OCR concept from MLKit.

•	Translate using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)- is an application for recognizing and extracting the text through camera and extracted text language can be identified and translated in any language. These features are included by Firebase ML Kit (Machine Learning) and Play Services packages for adding ML concepts to a application which were provided by Google for Android Development. 
•	The Purpose of chosen this idea to gain knowledgeable experience on Android development with implementation of machine learning concepts like text recognition, text extraction and user convenience.
•	The application is based on Android development, the overall application will included XML for User Interface, Java to provide the functioning of effective interface and connectivity, Google provided Firebase Kotlin packages to assign features of text recognition and translation concepts to the application.
•	The application is implemented in Android Studio Development Tool of Bumblebee version. With AVD (Android Virtual Device) of minimum SDK android version 7.0 Nougat and Target SDK android version 11.0.
•	ML Kit is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. Whether you're new or experienced  in machine learning, you can easily implement the functionality you need in just a few lines of code. There's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or     model optimization to get started.
•	What we learn -
         -	How to use the ML Kit SDK to easily add Machine Learning capabilities to any Android app.
         -	ML Kit Text Recognition, Language Identification, Translation APIs and their capabilities.
         -	How to use the CameraX library with ML Kit APIs.
